* What is wage theft?

  Wage theft is the failure to pay workers the full wages to which they
  are legally entitled. Examples include:

  - *Minimum wage violations:* Paying workers less than the legal minimum wage.
  - *Overtime violations:* Failing to pay nonexempt employees time and a half for hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week.
  - *Off-the-clock violations:* Asking employees to work off the clock before or after their shifts
  - *Meal break violations:* Denying workers their legal meal breaks
  - *Illegal deductions:* Taking illegal deductions from wages.
  - *Tipped minimum wage violations:* Confiscating tips from workers, or failing to pay tipped workers the difference between their tips and the legal minimum wage.
  - *Employee mis-classification violations:* Misclassifying employees as independent contractors to pay a wage lower than the legal minimum or avoid paying overtime.

  According to a report from the Economic Policy Institute, *it's estimated that low-wage workers in the U.S lost more than $50 billion to all forms of wage theft in 2016.*

"The Massachusetts group Community Labor United estimates wage theft costs workers in Massachusetts almost $700 million annually. The Attorney General’s Office, tasked with protecting workers in this state, successfully recovers $5.2 million annually.

In terms of daily averages, employers steal nearly $2 million of labor each day, and the Attorney General wins back just $14,330 in compensation."

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Cooper and Kroeger (2017) find that workers suffering minimum wage violations are cheated out of $64 a week—$3,300 annually for year-round workers. These workers lose almost one-quarter of their earnings, receiving on average only $10,500 in annual wages instead of the $13,800 they should have received.
#+END_QUOTE

The disproportionate share of wage theft victims are people of color, women, immigrants, young-people, workers from modest-income households non-unionized workers, and workers who do not have a bachelor's degree.
