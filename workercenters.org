* What are worker centers?

Worker  centers are community-based mediating institutions that provide support
to and organize among communities of low-wage workers. Most centers focus their
work geographically, operating in a particular city or neighborhood.

Worker centers in general have emerged in response to the decline of
institutions that historically povided workers with a vehcicle for collective
action. Immigrant worker centers have emerged as a consequence of the explosive
growth of immigrant communities and the absence of infrastucture to support
their needs.

The type of activities that worker centers engage in are: helping workers to claim unpaid wages,
working with government agencies to improve enforcement, mounting direct action
organizing campaigns against specific employers and engaging in leadership
development and popular education activities.
